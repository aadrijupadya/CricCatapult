# CricCatapult

#### A novel cricket data package with a focus on data visualization, easily accessible data, and data analysis

Packaging: https://pypi.org/project/criccatapult/0.0.8/

### To run/test out this package, simply clone the project and run it locally.

Due to API problems, the geography classes (Location, etc.) do not work with the current packaging. However, the rest of the classes are bug-free.
