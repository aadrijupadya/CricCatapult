#### A novel cricket data package with a focus on data visualization, easily accessible data, and data analysis, accepted to present at CMSAC (Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference) 2022 

Packaging: https://pypi.org/project/criccatapult/

### To run/test out this package, simply clone the project and run it locally.
### Alternatively run
```
pip install criccatapult
```

Due to API problems, the geography class (Location) does not work with the current packaging unless the geopandas library is seperately installed. 

```
pip install geopandas
```

However, the rest of the classes are bug-free.
